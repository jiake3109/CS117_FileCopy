//
//
//        This is a simple client, designed to illustrate use of:
//
//            * The C150DgmSocket class, which provides
//              a convenient wrapper for sending and receiving
//              UDP packets in a client/server model
//
//            * The c150debug interface, which provides a framework for
//              generating a timestamped log of debugging messages.
//              Note that the socket classes described above will
//              write to these same logs, providing information
//              about things like when UDP packets are sent and received.
//              See comments section below for more information on
//              these logging classes and what they can do.
//
//
//        COMMAND LINE
//
//              fileclient <server> <networknastiness> <filenastiness> <srcdir>
//
//
//        OPERATION
//
//              pingclient will send a single UDP packet
//              to the named server, and will wait (forever)
//              for a single UDP packet response. The contents
//              of the packet sent will be the msgtxt, including
//              a terminating null. The response message
//              is checked to ensure that it's null terminated.
//              For safety, this application will use a routine
//              to clean up any garbage characters the server
//              sent us, (so a malicious server can't crash us), and
//              then print the result.
//
//              Note that the C150DgmSocket class will select a UDP
//              port automatically based on the user's login, so this
//              will (typically) work only on the test machines at Tufts
//              and for COMP 150-IDS who are registered. See documention
//              for the comp150ids getUserPort routine if you are
//              curious, but you shouldn't have to worry about it.
//              The framework automatically runs on a separate port
//              for each user, as long as you are registerd in the
//              the student port mapping table (ask Noah or the TAs if
//              the program dies because you don't have a port).
//
//        LIMITATIONS
//
//              This version does not timeout or retry when packets are lost.
